## UX Design 

Solving Stress is designed to be intuitive to use and to present information in a clear and easy-to-read way. A navigation bar is placed at the top to help the user to move around the site and a footer can be found at the bottom linking to social media pages.

The hero image is used at the start of the page to provide an insight for the user into the theme that will be explored in the site. 

A navbar containing the website title  on the left with logo was used followed by clear links to other parts of the site, it has been designed responsively so will show an burger when the site is viewed on mobile screens (x px and smaller). 

### Style 

A colour palette focusing on different shades of green as well as some contrasting darker colours (English violet and Rosy brown) from Coolers was used to provide a consistent colour theme throughout the site.

### Development Considerations

Upon deciding to choose mental health awareness as a topic, I considered the key features of the site and designed basic wireframes and mockup sites to help refine the design process. I used a brainstorming process to consider the user goals, key features, potential ideas and key components.
